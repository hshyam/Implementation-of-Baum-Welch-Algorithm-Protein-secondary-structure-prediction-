Protein secondary structure prediction

In this project, I implemented the Baum-Welch Algorithm for the problem of protein secondary structure prediction.

1. Designed the HMM representation of protein secondary structure prediction, e.g. three states representing hexlices, sheets and loops; emissions are the on the 20 amino acide residues. 

2. Used maximum likelihood learning to train a HMM with the training data, called HMM_ml. Note that both amino acid sequence and secondary structure sequence should be used to train HMM_ml. 

3. Implemented Baum-Welch algorithm for HMM training. Learned a HMM with the test data, called HMM_bw.

4. Applied HMM_ml and HMM_bw to predict the secondary structure of the test data. 

Dataset:
A protein secondary structure dataset is provided here. The training data is in protein-secondary-structure.train and the test data is in protein-secondary-structure.test.
